<h3>The sus virus is a joke, it does not exist. Your computer is not infected </br>
</br>
This website works by exploiting browsers and chat clients caching, which saves the thumbnail image to your storage. The image it saves is specifically designed to trick antiviruses into believing that it is malicious content for the purpose of a joke.</br>
</br>
However, the code is within an image/png file and therefore has no way to execute. But even if it did, all it is capable of is saving a file from Discord CDN which is an Image and setting it to your desktop background. Infact this joke is so old that the picture has since been purged from Discord's CDN entirely and just results in a 404 so there is literally no possible consequence from anything that this site contains.</br>
</br>
Don't believe it, trust your antivirus too much? That's fine. You can download the image file manually at /thesusvirus2.png and look at it in any hex editor, or try running it in a sandbox environment. At the end of the day it cannot execute anyways, so all that's well ends well. </br>
</br>
If you enjoy this site and think its a funny joke, then feel free to share it with your friends. If you really, really, love this site you can drop some XMR to <b>46ST5SNiu3DD79ZscdAHqCK66TN5A9EYPDuxWdg9cG7U5D7S41bVYGoWcifziMSgY57hX9Vd8vVVbQeyNfRLV8maBjGkwQw</b> to pay for the domain in a year.</br>
